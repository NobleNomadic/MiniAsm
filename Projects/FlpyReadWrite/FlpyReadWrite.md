# Floppy Disk Read Write
This project will read and write data to the second sector of the floppy disk running the OS.
This is done with BIOS interupts in 16 bit real mode from a single bootloader file.

I spent ages trying to get some kind of permanent disk writing working.
I have no idea why this current version was able to write to the disk, but it did.
